	 <li> BioconResearch Ltd. Bangalore 
	 	<br> <p1> Worked at Research & Development department at pilot scale under the project titled “Purification of
                  peptides at pilot scale through High pressure chromatography” </p1> </li>
	 <li> Lupin Ltd. (BioTech), Pune 
	 	<br> <p1> Worked at Research and Bio-Analytical department under the project title “Characterization of
                  monoclonal antibodies using different bio-analytical techniques”</p1> </li>
	 <li> Agilent Technologies, Ahmedabad
	 <br> <p1> Worked as a Field Application Engineer in LC-MS division and gained experience in bio-pharma, food
              and life science applications. Had acquired knowledge of working principles of single, triple quadrupoles
              and QTOF instruments.</p1> </li>
	 <li> Zelle Biotechnology, Mumbai
	 <br> <p1> Currently working as a Sr. Development Assistant in the mass spectrometry lab in Analytical division.
               Characterization of mAbs using mass spectrometry methods such as Intact, Subunit, Glycan and Peptide

	<h3> Lab Experience </h3>
	<ul>
	<li> Glycan Analysis of Monoclonal Antibodies:
		<br> <p1> LC-MS and LC-FLR based method analysis for determining the presence of glycan’s in the samples
                  involving sample preparation, HILIC chromatography and mass spectrometry. This involved unique
                  approach for identification of glycan structures based on GU values, retention time and accurate
                  intact mass <p1>
	<li> Intact and Subunit Mass analysis:
		<br> <p1> LCMS based method to determine the intact mass of the monoclonal antibodies. Subunit analysis is
                  to determine and confirm the glycosylated forms present on the subunits of the mAbs. </p1>
    <li> Peptide Mapping and Modification Identification:
    	<br> <p1> Method development on Mass spectrometry for determining the modification observed in
                  biosimilars and Innovator samples.</p1>
    <li> Development & analytical HPLC method:
    	<br> <p1> Method development on Ion exchange, Reverse phase, Protein A and Size exclusion
                  chromatography for characterization of mAbs.</p1>
    <li>Structural characterization of Antibody using DSC:
    	<br> <p1> Characterization of antibodies using Differential scanning colorimetric (Nano DSC) for determining
                  the tm values </p1> </li> </li> </li></li></p1></p1></li></ul>
